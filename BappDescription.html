<p>
API_Sword is an extension for Burp Suite that automatically and recursively collects API endpoints from any response. This tool is built with a focus on open source development and collaboration. API_Sword has aided its developers in achieving significant results in their projects and finding common zero-day vulnerabilities. It has eliminated the need for manual search of any interface, path or parameter from any JavaScript files.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
API_Sword operates with full automation and loop prevention. It extracts APIs and JavaScript files from various responses, then recursively and deeply extracts APIs and proactively requests valuable files such as APIs, JavaScripts, etc. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>API_Sword captures traffic within the range of Burp, and extracts most links from http responses.</li>
    <li>The extension filters any links and paths from the previous step and upon judgement, API_Sword can actively initiate GET and POST requests for APIs, JavaScripts, etc.</li>
    <li>API_Sword further processes the responses from proactive requests, continues to extract information from the responses and repeats the previous action. API_Sword has a loop prevention feature, hence there is no need to worry about indefinite loop requests.</li>
    <li>All conforming API requests and responses, including the source JavaScript file response of the API interface, are all pushed to the API_Swords Burp GUI.</li>
    <li>API_Sword automatically adds all relevant requests to the Burps target sitemap. You can enjoy the results generated by API_Sword in the analysis function of targets sitemap.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Users only need to start API_Sword and set a reasonable range, then continue clicking on various functions of the web system in the browser and let all traffic pass through Burp, finally give API_Sword the task of analyzing and processing. API_Sword will return the sought result.
</p>
<p>
Considering operational security risks, API_Sword does not actively fuzz parameters at this moment.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
The usage of API_Sword is very simple. 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Install the extension to a version later than Burp 2024 and make sure there are no errors.</li>
    <li>Set scope for the extension.</li>
    <li>Open the browser and make sure the browsers traffic passes through Burp.</li>
    <li>Enter the target website, click and test all functions seen on the website.</li>
    <li>After some time, check the results from API_Swords Sitemap.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the Scope tab, we can set the scope. This scope can be url, domain, or ip. This setup is particularly important, consider it carefully, otherwise, you may scan into extra-terrestrial space.
</p>
<p>
In the Settings tab, you have several options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow proactive API requests</li>
    <li>Use original headers</li>
    <li>Stop sending all requests immediately</li>
    <li>Enable active HTTP request rate</li>
    <li>Allow additional customized path requests when making proactive requests</li>
    <li>Filter out non-200 customized response codes</li>
    <li>Allow API_Sword to actively find baseURL from response and actively splice paths for baseURL</li>
    <li>Add custom header fields</li>
    <li>Enable bypass</li>
</ul>
